<summary>Meet and Greet Prompt</summary>

* __My response:__ Iâ€‹ am Alexander "Aleksey" Ahmann. I lived in New York for my entire life (and still do). I signed up for this programme to get my bona fides as a data analyst and hopefully use this experience (and the certificate that comes with it) to demonstrate to employers that I am competent in data analysis. I am an undergraduate student of computer science with a minor in mathematics, and I intend to use this certification to be articulated into credits for my college degree. I don't have much interest outside of STEM science other than cartoons (I'm addicted to my special interests which are sciency things).
