<summary>Video 1.1.4: Cassie: Dimensions of data analytics</summary>

* "Key Ideas" highlighted by the makers of this video, verbatim:
    * Cassie leads Decision Intelligence for Google Cloud.
    * Decision Intelligence for Google Cloud is a combination of applied data science and social and managerial sciences.
    * According to Cassie, analytics is a quest for inspiration.
    * Cassie’s advice is to pick your specialization based on which flavor of impact best suits your personality.
    * When you are considering data science and choosing which area to specialize in, it is recommended that you go with your personality.
    * The excellence of statistics is rigor; the excellence of an analyst is speed. Performance is one of the machine learning and artificial intelligence engineers’ goals.
    * If you thrive on creative projects and you are comfortable working with data that no one has looked at before, and the ambiguity of exploration excites you, then analytics is probably the best fit for you.
    
* A data analyst can be seen as "an explorer, detective and artist all rolled into one."

* Difference between _statistics_, _machine learning and AI_, and _data analysis:_
    * __Statistics__ is the tool to make "a few important decisions under uncertainty."
        * Many statistians prefer rigour. Statisticans can be seen as philosophers who want to make sure that wrong decisions aren't being made.
    * __Machine learning and AI__ is the tool to automate making many decisions under uncertainty.
        * Many ML and AI enginers prefer performance and suit the "engineering" kind of person.
    * __Data analysis__ is the tool for generating questions and "finding inspiration."
        * Data analysts perfer speed in their ability to generate new insights from raw data. They also like "open ended projects" and things that require a lot of independence.
