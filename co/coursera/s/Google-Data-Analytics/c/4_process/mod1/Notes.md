* A strong analysis depends on the integrity of the data.
* __Data integrity__ is the accuracy, completeness, consistency and trustworthiness of the data throughout its lifecycle.
* Data integrity can be compromised when data is:
    * __Replicated__, or stored in multiple locations.
    * __Transferred__, or copied from a storage device to memory, or from one computer to another.
    * __Manipulated__, or changed to make it more organised and easier to read.
    * Other threats include: _human error_, _viruses_, _malware_, _hacking_ and _system failures_.
