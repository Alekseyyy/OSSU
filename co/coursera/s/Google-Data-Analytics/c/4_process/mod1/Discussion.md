<summary>Prompt: As a data analyst, youâ€™ll have the chance to explore lots of different datasets. But before you begin, there are some important questions to consider: \[w\]hat steps might you take when you open a dataset for the first time? What have you learned about in this course that you can apply as you explore the dataset?</summary>

* __My response:__ I think that when I open up a dataset for the first time, I will need to make sure that it has maintained some integrity. For example, if I'm downloading a CSV or SQLite database from the internet, I may want to compare its MD5 or SHA1/SHA256 checksums to the ones provided on the website to make sure that it hasn't been corrupted. I may also want to inspect the file's metadata to make sure the credentials are valid.
